# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive, optimized test automation framework that can be used to test any kind of website. The framework will be built using Java, Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Maven, and include configuration management through properties files. The framework should be modular, maintainable, and scalable to support various testing scenarios across different web applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want a standardized project structure with Maven, so that I can easily manage dependencies and build processes across different projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the framework is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a Maven-based project structure with proper directory layout
2. WHEN dependencies are managed THEN the system SHALL use Maven pom.xml to handle all required libraries including Selenium, TestNG, and reporting tools
3. WHEN the project is built THEN Maven SHALL compile all source code and execute tests successfully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want centralized configuration management, so that I can easily modify test parameters without changing code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is needed THEN the system SHALL read from config.properties file for environment-specific settings
2. WHEN browser configuration is required THEN the system SHALL support multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) through configuration
3. WHEN test URLs are specified THEN the system SHALL allow base URL configuration for different environments (dev, staging, prod)
4. WHEN timeouts are configured THEN the system SHALL support configurable implicit and explicit wait times

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want a robust WebDriver management system, so that I can run tests across different browsers and environments reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a test starts THEN the system SHALL initialize the appropriate WebDriver based on configuration
2. WHEN browser options are needed THEN the system SHALL support headless mode and custom browser arguments
3. WHEN tests run in parallel THEN the system SHALL manage WebDriver instances using ThreadLocal for thread safety
4. WHEN a test completes THEN the system SHALL properly close and cleanup WebDriver resources

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want reusable page object models, so that I can maintain test code efficiently and reduce duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN page interactions are needed THEN the system SHALL implement Page Object Model pattern with PageFactory
2. WHEN common actions are performed THEN the system SHALL provide base page class with common methods (click, type, wait, etc.)
3. WHEN page elements are located THEN the system SHALL use robust locator strategies with fallback options
4. WHEN page validation is required THEN the system SHALL include assertion methods in page objects

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want comprehensive test execution and reporting capabilities, so that I can track test results and debug failures effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN the system SHALL use TestNG for test organization and execution
2. WHEN test results are generated THEN the system SHALL produce detailed HTML reports with screenshots
3. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL automatically capture screenshots and attach them to reports
4. WHEN parallel execution is needed THEN the system SHALL support configurable parallel test execution
5. WHEN test data is required THEN the system SHALL support data-driven testing with TestNG DataProvider

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want utility classes and helper methods, so that I can perform common testing operations efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN file operations are needed THEN the system SHALL provide utilities for reading test data from Excel, CSV, and JSON files
2. WHEN database validation is required THEN the system SHALL include database connection utilities
3. WHEN API testing is needed THEN the system SHALL provide REST API testing utilities
4. WHEN custom waits are required THEN the system SHALL include explicit wait utilities with custom conditions
5. WHEN test data generation is needed THEN the system SHALL provide fake data generation utilities

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want logging and debugging capabilities, so that I can troubleshoot test failures and monitor test execution.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests execute THEN the system SHALL log all actions and events using a logging framework
2. WHEN debugging is needed THEN the system SHALL provide configurable log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
3. WHEN test analysis is required THEN the system SHALL generate detailed execution logs with timestamps
4. WHEN failures occur THEN the system SHALL log stack traces and relevant context information

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a test automation engineer, I want CI/CD integration capabilities, so that I can run tests in automated pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests run in CI/CD THEN the system SHALL support command-line execution with parameters
2. WHEN different environments are targeted THEN the system SHALL accept environment configuration via system properties
3. WHEN test suites are executed THEN the system SHALL support TestNG suite XML files for test organization
4. WHEN results are published THEN the system SHALL generate reports in formats compatible with CI/CD tools
